# Credit Card Default Prediction

## Introduction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of credit card default based on the characteristics of the credit card clients. The data used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. The project uses machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model and evaluate its performance.

## Modules and Versions
The following modules were used in this project:

* Python version: 3.8.5
* NumPy version: 1.19.2
* Pandas version: 1.2.0
* Matplotlib version: 3.3.2
* Scikit-learn version: 0.23.2
* TensorFlow version: 2.4.0

## Setup
To run this project, you will need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
After installing the required packages, you can run the Jupyter notebook by executing the following command in your terminal:

```
jupyter notebook CreditCardDefaultPrediction.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter notebook in your browser, where you can run the code and view the results.

Note that the dataset used in this project should be in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook. The dataset can be downloaded from the Kaggle page.
